# Responsive embed

Allow browsers to determine video or slideshow dimensions based on the width of their containing block by creating an intrinsic ratio that will properly scale on any device.

Rules are directly applied to `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, `<video>`, and `<object>` elements;
optionally use an explicit descendant class `.embed-responsive-item` when you want to match the styling for other attributes.
